<h1>Charge</h1>
<p class="subtitle">
The intrinsic property of matter responsible for all electromagnetic interactions.
</p>

<section>
<h2>What is Charge?</h2>
<p>
Electric charge is a fundamental, intrinsic property of matter, much like mass. It is the root source of all electromagnetic phenomena. While mass dictates how matter interacts gravitationally, charge dictates how matter interacts via electric and magnetic fields.
</p>
<div class="insightbox">
Fundamental particles possess both mass and charge. The standard SI unit of charge is the Coulomb (\(\text{C}\)).

<h2>How does a body acquire charge?</h2>
<p>
Macroscopic bodies are generally electrically neutral because they contain equal numbers of protons and electrons. Electrification—the process of a body acquiring a net charge—occurs exclusively through the transfer of electrons. 
</p>

<p>
Since protons are tightly bound within the atomic nucleus by strong nuclear forces, they do not participate in ordinary charging processes. Therefore, if a body exhibits a net positive charge, it is <em>lacking</em> electrons. If it exhibits a net negative charge, it has an <em>excess</em> of electrons.

<h2>Historical Context: Electromagnetic Phenomena</h2>
<p>
Historically, physicists treated electric and magnetic phenomena as distinct, unrelated subjects. Ancient civilizations observed that amber, when rubbed with fur, attracted light objects like feathers (electric effect). Separately, they observed that naturally occurring lodestone attracted iron (magnetic effect). It was initially believed that these phenomena were uniquely dependent on the specific materials involved.
</p>
<div class="insightbox">
Later discoveries unified these fields, revealing that both phenomena are dictated by charge. Stationary charges produce electric fields, whereas moving charges produce magnetic fields. Charge is the fundamental unifying entity.

<h2>Fundamental Properties of Charge</h2>
<p>
To formulate equations in electrostatics, we must rely on three rigorously established mathematical properties of isolated charge:
</p>

<h3>1. Quantization of Charge</h3>
<p>
Charge does not exist in continuous amounts. It exists only in discrete packets. The total charge \(q\) on a body is always an integral multiple of the fundamental elementary charge \(e\) (the charge of a single electron or proton).
</p>
<p>
Mathematically, this is expressed as:
</p>
\[q = \pm ne\]
<p>
where \(n\) is an integer (\(1, 2, 3, \dots\)) and \(e \approx 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}\).
</p>
<div class="insightbox">
<strong>Exception:</strong> In particle physics, fundamental particles called quarks possess fractional charges (\(\pm \frac{1}{3}e\) and \(\pm \frac{2}{3}e\)). However, due to a principle called color confinement, quarks can never exist in isolation. Therefore, at the macroscopic scale, the quantization principle \(q = \pm ne\) holds perfectly true.
</div>

<h3>2. Conservation of Charge</h3>
<p>
For any isolated system, the total algebraic sum of charges remains absolutely constant over time. Charge can neither be created nor destroyed; it can only be transferred from one body to another. Even in high-energy nuclear reactions where mass is converted to energy, the net charge before and after the reaction remains identical.
</p>

<h3>3. Relativistic Invariance</h3>
<p>
Unlike mass, which increases as an object's velocity approaches the speed of light, the charge of a particle is entirely independent of its speed or the frame of reference of the observer. A charge \(q\) measured at rest will measure exactly as \(q\) when moving at any velocity \(v\).
