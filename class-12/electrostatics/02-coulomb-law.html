        <h2>What is Coulomb's Law?</h2>
        <p>
            Coulomb's Law defines the magnitude and direction of the electrostatic force acting between two stationary point charges. It states that the electrostatic force is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance separating them.
        </p>
        <p>
            The force acts along the straight line joining the two charges. It is an attractive force if the charges are of opposite signs and a repulsive force if they are of the same sign.
        </p>

        <h2>How do we calculate the force? (Scalar Form)</h2>
        <p>
            For two point charges \(q_1\) and \(q_2\) separated by a distance \(r\) in a vacuum, the magnitude of the electrostatic force \(F\) is given by:
        </p>
        \[F = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}\]
        <p>
            Here, \(\varepsilon_0\) is the permittivity of free space, representing how much the vacuum permits electric field lines to establish themselves. Its value is approximately \(8.85 \times 10^{-12} \text{ C}^2\text{N}^{-1}\text{m}^{-2}\). The constant factor \(\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\) is often denoted as \(k\), with a value of \(9 \times 10^9 \text{ N m}^2\text{C}^{-2}\).
        </p>
        <div class="insightbox">
            When calculating force magnitude using this scalar form, we use the absolute values of the charges. The direction (attraction or repulsion) is determined conceptually by observing the signs of the charges.
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Coulomb's Law in Vector Form (3D Space)</h2>
        <p>
            In mechanics and real-world JEE problems, charges exist in three-dimensional space. To define the force rigorously and eliminate directional ambiguity, we must use vector notation. This automatically accounts for the direction without needing to rely on conceptual checks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let charge \(q_1\) be at position vector \(\vec{r}_1\) and charge \(q_2\) be at position vector \(\vec{r}_2\) with respect to a common origin. 
        </p>
        
        

        <p>
            The displacement vector pointing from \(q_1\) to \(q_2\) is:
        </p>
        \[\vec{r}_{21} = \vec{r}_2 - \vec{r}_1\]
        <p>
            The force exerted <strong>on</strong> charge \(q_2\) <strong>by</strong> charge \(q_1\), denoted as \(\vec{F}_{21}\), is:
        </p>
        \[\vec{F}_{21} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{q_1 q_2}{|\vec{r}_2 - \vec{r}_1|^3} (\vec{r}_2 - \vec{r}_1)\]
        <div class="insightbox">
            <strong>Critical Rule:</strong> In the vector formulation, you <strong>must</strong> substitute the charges \(q_1\) and \(q_2\) with their actual algebraic signs. The vector mathematics will automatically yield the correct direction. A positive product yields a repulsive vector pointing away from \(q_1\), while a negative product yields an attractive vector pointing toward \(q_1\).
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Principle of Superposition</h2>
        <p>
            Coulomb's Law rigorously defines the force between <em>two</em> charges. But how do we determine the net force on a charge when multiple source charges are present?
        </p>
        <p>
            The Principle of Superposition states that the net electrostatic force on any given charge is the vector sum of the individual forces exerted on it by all other charges in the system. 
        </p>
        
        

        <p>
            Crucially, the two-body force between any specific pair of charges is completely unaffected by the presence or absence of other charges in the vicinity. If we want the net force \(\vec{F}_{\text{net}}\) on charge \(q_0\) due to an assembly of charges \(q_1, q_2, \dots, q_n\):
        </p>
        \[\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \vec{F}_{01} + \vec{F}_{02} + \dots + \vec{F}_{0n}\]
        \[\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{q_0 q_i}{|\vec{r}_0 - \vec{r}_i|^3} (\vec{r}_0 - \vec{r}_i)\]

        <h2>Exceptions and Limitations</h2>
        <p>
            Coulomb's law is a fundamental pillar of electrostatics, but it is strictly valid only under specific boundary conditions. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Point Charges Only:</strong> The law assumes the charges have no spatial extent. For extended bodies (like charged rods or discs), Coulomb's law cannot be applied directly to the macroscopic body. We must slice the body into infinitesimal point charges (\(dq\)) and integrate using the superposition principle. <br><em>Exception:</em> Spherical charge distributions behave identically to point charges when observing the field from outside the sphere.</li>
            <li><strong>Static Charges:</strong> The charges must be at rest. If the source charges are moving, they generate magnetic fields in addition to electric fields, requiring the application of the Lorentz force law.</li>
            <li><strong>Nuclear Distances:</strong> At distances smaller than \(10^{-15} \text{ m}\), the strong nuclear force overwhelmingly dominates the electrostatic repulsion. This is why atomic nuclei hold together despite the immense repulsive Coulomb forces between tightly packed protons.</li>
        </ul>
