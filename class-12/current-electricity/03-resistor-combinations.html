Structural reduction of linear networks into equivalent black-box parameters.

<section>
<h2>3.1 The Concept of Equivalent Resistance</h2>
<p>
The core principle of circuit reduction is replacement without external alteration. If a complex network of resistors is placed inside a "black box" with two emerging terminals, the <strong>Equivalent Resistance (\(R_{eq}\))</strong> is the value of a single resistor that could replace the entire box such that for the same applied potential difference (\(V\)), the exact same total current (\(I\)) is drawn from the source.

<h2>3.2 Series Combination: The Constraint of Charge Conservation</h2>
<p>
Resistors are in series if they are connected end-to-end such that there are no branching nodes between them. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>The Structural Rule:</strong> Because charge cannot accumulate at any point in a steady-state conductor (Conservation of Charge), the exact same current \(I\) must flow through every resistor.
</p>
<div class="model-box">
    <h3>Derivation via Energy Conservation</h3>
    <p>The total potential drop across the combination must equal the sum of the individual potential drops (Conservation of Energy):</p>
    \[V_{\text{total}} = V_1 + V_2 + V_3\]
    <p>Applying Ohm's Law (\(V = IR\)) to each component:</p>
    \[I R_{eq} = I R_1 + I R_2 + I R_3\]
    \[R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3\]
</div>
<div class="insightbox">
In series, the equivalent resistance is always strictly greater than the largest individual resistance in the chain. The circuit acts as a voltage divider, where \(V \propto R\).

<h2>3.3 Parallel Combination: The Constraint of Equipotential Nodes</h2>
<p>
Resistors are in parallel if all their starting ends are connected to a single common node, and all their terminating ends are connected to another common node.
</p>

<p>
<strong>The Structural Rule:</strong> Because the terminals of all resistors share the same two equipotential nodes, the potential difference (\(V\)) across every resistor is strictly identical, regardless of their resistance values.
</p>
<div class="model-box">
    <h3>Derivation via Charge Conservation</h3>
    <p>The total current entering the primary node must equal the sum of the currents branching into the individual resistors:</p>
    \[I_{\text{total}} = I_1 + I_2 + I_3\]
    <p>Applying Ohm's Law (\(I = V/R\)) to each branch:</p>
    \[\frac{V}{R_{eq}} = \frac{V}{R_1} + \frac{V}{R_2} + \frac{V}{R_3}\]
    \[\frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3}\]
</div>
<div class="insightbox">
In parallel, the equivalent resistance is always strictly less than the smallest individual resistance in the network. The circuit acts as a current divider, where \(I \propto 1/R\).
