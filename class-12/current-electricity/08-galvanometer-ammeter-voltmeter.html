<h1>Electric Current and Drift Velocity</h1>
<p class="subtitle">
The macroscopic flow of charge and its microscopic mechanical origin.
</p>

<section>
<h2>1. The Definition of Current: Motion vs. Flow</h2>
<p>
Electric current is not merely the presence of moving charges; it is the macroscopic <strong>flow</strong> of charge. Flow is a mathematical concept that requires a defined boundary—a surface or "gate"—through which the entity passes.
</p>

<p>
If a net charge \(\Delta Q\) crosses a specific cross-sectional area in time \(\Delta t\), the average current is defined as:
</p>
\[I_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}\]
<p>
For instantaneous flow, we take the limit as \(\Delta t \to 0\):
</p>
\[I = \frac{dQ}{dt}\]
<div class="insightbox">
The SI unit of current is the Ampere (\(\text{A}\)), where \(1 \text{ A} = 1 \text{ C/s}\). By convention, the direction of macroscopic current is taken as the direction of flow of positive charges, which is opposite to the actual physical flow of electrons.
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>2. Frame Invariance of Current</h2>
<p>
A crucial structural consequence of defining current with respect to a physical "gate" (the cross-sectional area of the conductor) is that classical current is a frame-invariant quantity.
</p>
<p>
Consider an observer moving at a constant velocity parallel to a current-carrying wire. To the moving observer, the absolute velocity of the electrons changes. However, the absolute velocity of the wire (the gate) also changes by the exact same amount.
</p>
<div class="insightbox">
Current is determined by the <em>relative velocity</em> between the charge carriers and the physical cross-section of the wire. Since Galilean transformations shift both velocities equally, the relative velocity remains constant. Therefore, the rate of charge crossing the gate (\(dQ/dt\)) is invariant regardless of the observer's inertial frame.

<h2>3. Thermal Motion vs. Drift Velocity</h2>
<p>
In a typical metallic conductor at room temperature, free electrons are not stationary. They exist in a state of chaotic thermal motion, colliding frequently with the heavy, fixed positive ions of the lattice.
</p>

<div class="model-box">
    <h3>State 1: No External Field (\(\vec{E} = 0\))</h3>
    <p>
    The electrons move at high thermal speeds (\(\sim 10^5 \text{ m/s}\)), but the motion is entirely random. For any chosen cross-sectional area, the number of electrons crossing from left to right exactly equals the number crossing from right to left.
    </p>
    \[\vec{u}_{\text{avg}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \vec{u}_i = 0\]
    <p>Since the net directional velocity is zero, there is motion, but no net flow. \(I = 0\).</p>
</div>

<div class="model-box">
    <h3>State 2: External Field Applied (\(\vec{E} \neq 0\))</h3>
    <p>
    When a potential difference is applied, an electric field \(\vec{E}\) is established inside the conductor. This exerts a constant force \(\vec{F} = -e\vec{E}\) on every electron, causing an acceleration \(\vec{a} = -e\vec{E}/m\).
    </p>
    <p>
    This acceleration imposes a very slow, organized directional shift onto the chaotic thermal motion. This net directional velocity is the <strong>drift velocity (\(\vec{v}_d\))</strong>.
    </p>
</div>

<p>
If \(\tau\) is the average relaxation time (the average time between successive collisions), the drift velocity is derived from basic kinematics (\(\vec{v} = \vec{u} + \vec{a}t\)):
</p>
\[\vec{v}_d = -\frac{e \vec{E}}{m} \tau\]
<div class="insightbox">
Drift velocity is extremely small (\(\sim 10^{-4} \text{ m/s}\)), yet the collective movement of the massive number of free electrons is the sole cause of macroscopic current.
</div>

<h2>4. The Drift Current Equation</h2>
<p>
We bridge the microscopic kinematics (\(v_d\)) to the macroscopic flow (\(I\)). Consider a conductor of cross-sectional area \(A\) and free electron density \(n\) (number of electrons per unit volume).
</p>
<p>
In a time interval \(dt\), the distance the electron cloud drifts is \(dx = v_d dt\). The volume of the charge cylinder that crosses the "gate" \(A\) in this time is:
</p>
\[dV = A \cdot dx = A v_d dt\]
<p>
The total number of free electrons in this volume is \(N = n \cdot dV = n A v_d dt\). Since each electron carries a charge \(e\), the total charge crossing the area is:
</p>
\[dQ = N e = n e A v_d dt\]
<p>
Dividing by \(dt\) yields the fundamental structural equation of current:
</p>
\[I = n e A v_d\]
</section>

<section>
<h2>5. Current Density (\(\vec{J}\))</h2>
<p>
While current \(I\) is a scalar, it is often necessary to describe flow at a specific point in space. We define <strong>Current Density (\(\vec{J}\))</strong> as the current per unit area taken normal to the direction of flow.
</p>
\[J = \frac{I}{A} = n e v_d\]
<p>
Current density is a vector quantity, pointing in the direction of positive charge flow (the direction of \(\vec{E}\)):
</p>
\[\vec{J} = -n e \vec{v}_d\]
<p>
This definition allows us to formally define total macroscopic current as the surface integral of the microscopic current density over the cross-sectional area \(S\):
</p>
\[I = \int_S \vec{J} \cdot d\vec{A}\]
