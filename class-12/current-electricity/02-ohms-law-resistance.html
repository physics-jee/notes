<h1>Ohm's Law and Resistance</h1>
<p class="subtitle">
The mathematical model of steady-state dissipation and the failure of pure kinematics.
</p>

<section>
<h2>1. The Need for Ohm's Law: A Kinematic Failure</h2>
<p>
To understand the necessity of Ohm's Law, we must look at what happens if we only apply Newtonian mechanics to a charge in an electric field.
</p>
<p>
If an electric field \(\vec{E}\) is applied inside a vacuum, an electron experiences a constant force \(\vec{F} = -e\vec{E}\). According to Newton's Second Law, this produces a constant acceleration:
</p>
\[\vec{a} = -\frac{e\vec{E}}{m}\]
<p>
Kinematics (\(v = u + at\)) dictates that the electron's velocity should increase continuously towards infinity as long as the field is applied. Consequently, the current should also increase continuously over time. 
</p>
<div class="insightbox">
<strong>The Contradiction:</strong> In reality, when we connect a battery to a wire, the current does not increase infinitely; it instantly settles to a constant, steady value. Pure kinematics fails to describe steady-state current.
</div>
<p>
We need a law that accounts for the fact that conductors are not vacuums. Electrons constantly collide with the vibrating lattice ions, losing their kinetic energy. Ohm's law is the necessary mathematical model that equates the input of energy from the field with the dissipation of energy through collisions, resulting in a steady drift velocity.
</p>

<h2>2. The Microscopic Form (The Fundamental Truth)</h2>
<p>
Because the collisions limit the velocity, the drift velocity \(v_d\) becomes strictly proportional to the applied electric field \(E\), rather than accelerating continuously.
</p>
\[v_d = \left(\frac{e\tau}{m}\right) E\]
<p>
We established previously that current density is \(J = nev_d\). Substituting \(v_d\) into this equation yields:
</p>
\[J = n e \left(\frac{e\tau}{m}\right) E = \left(\frac{ne^2\tau}{m}\right) E\]
<p>
The term in the parentheses consists entirely of material properties (electron density \(n\)) and thermal state properties (relaxation time \(\tau\)). We bundle these into a single constant called <strong>Conductivity (\(\sigma\))</strong>.
</p>
<div class="model-box">
    <h3>Microscopic Ohm's Law</h3>
    \[\vec{J} = \sigma \vec{E}\]
    <p>Where conductivity \(\sigma = \frac{ne^2\tau}{m}\). The reciprocal of conductivity is <strong>Resistivity (\(\rho = 1/\sigma\))</strong>, which represents the material's intrinsic opposition to charge flow.</p>
</div>
<p>
This is the fundamental physical truth of Ohm's Law: Local current density is directly proportional to the local electric field.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>3. The Macroscopic Form (Circuit Application)</h2>
<p>
While \(\vec{J} = \sigma \vec{E}\) is structurally pure, we cannot easily measure \(\vec{J}\) or \(\vec{E}\) with standard lab equipment. We measure macroscopic variables: Current (\(I\)) and Potential Difference (\(V\)).
</p>
<p>
Consider a uniform cylindrical conductor of length \(L\) and cross-sectional area \(A\). 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The uniform electric field is related to potential difference by \(E = V/L\).</li>
    <li>The current density is related to total current by \(J = I/A\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Substituting these into the microscopic law:
</p>
\[\frac{I}{A} = \sigma \left(\frac{V}{L}\right)\]
\[V = I \left(\frac{L}{\sigma A}\right)\]
<p>
Since \(\rho = 1/\sigma\), we define the geometric and material grouping as <strong>Resistance (\(R\))</strong>:
</p>
\[R = \rho \frac{L}{A}\]
<div class="model-box">
    <h3>Macroscopic Ohm's Law</h3>
    \[V = I R\]
    <p>This formulation allows us to analyze the entire component dynamically without worrying about the internal microscopic collisions.</p>
</div>
</section>

<h2>4. The Structural Meaning of Resistance</h2>
<p>
Resistance is not merely an "obstruction" or a blockade. If it were a physical blockade, charge would pile up and violate the conservation of charge. 
</p>
<div class="insightbox">
Structurally, Resistance (\(R\)) is the mathematical parameter that quantifies the rate at which electrical potential energy is irreversibly converted into thermal energy (Joule heating). It is the electrical analogue to mechanical friction.
