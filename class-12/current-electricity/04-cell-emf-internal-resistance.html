<h1>Cell EMF and Internal Resistance</h1>

The non-electrostatic mechanism that sustains steady-state dynamics.

<h2>4.1 The Mechanism of a Cell</h2>
<p>
An electric cell is not a source of charge; it is an energy pump. In an external circuit, positive charge naturally flows from high potential to low potential along the electric field. To maintain a steady current, there must be a mechanism inside the cell that pumps the charge <em>back</em> from low potential to high potential, against the electrostatic force.
</p>

<p>
This requires a non-electrostatic force (usually chemical), denoted as \(\vec{F}_n\). 
</p>

<section>
<h2>4.2 Electromotive Force (EMF)</h2>
<p>
Despite its historical name, EMF (\(E\) or \(\varepsilon\)) is not a force. It is defined as the work done by the non-electrostatic agency in moving a unit positive charge from the lower potential terminal to the higher potential terminal.
</p>
\[E = \frac{W_{\text{non-electrostatic}}}{q}\]
<div class="insightbox">
EMF is an intrinsic characteristic of the cell's chemistry. It represents the maximum possible potential difference across the cell terminals when absolutely no current is drawn (an open circuit).

<h2>4.3 Internal Resistance and Terminal Voltage</h2>
<p>
When charge is pumped through the cell, it must physically travel through the electrolyte. The electrolyte is not a perfect conductor; it collides with the moving ions, dissipating some of the pumped energy. This opposition is the <strong>Internal Resistance (\(r\))</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Because of this internal energy loss, the voltage available to the external circuit—the <strong>Terminal Voltage (\(V\))</strong>—is not always equal to the EMF.
</p>

<div class="model-box">
    <h3>Case 1: Discharging (Acting as a Source)</h3>
    <p>Current \(I\) leaves the positive terminal. The cell does work, but loses \(Ir\) volts internally.</p>
    \[V = E - Ir\]
</div>

<div class="model-box">
    <h3>Case 2: Charging (Acting as a Load)</h3>
    <p>An external, stronger source forces current \(I\) into the positive terminal. The external source must overcome both the cell's EMF and its internal resistance.</p>
    \[V = E + Ir\]
