<h1>Introduction to Physics</h1>
<p class="subtitle">
Physics as a quantitative branch of natural science.
</p>

<section>

<h2>1. Branches of Scientific Knowledge</h2>

<p>
Human knowledge may be broadly classified into two large domains:
</p>

<div class="model-box">
<ul>
<li><strong>Formal Sciences</strong></li>
<li><strong>Natural Sciences</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Formal Sciences</h3>
<p>
Mathematics and logic belong here.
They study abstract structures and relations.
Their conclusions follow from definitions and rules of deduction.
They do not depend on experiment.
</p>

<p>
For example, \(1 + 2 = 3\) is true because of how we define the symbols
“1”, “2”, “3”, the operation “+”, and the meaning of “=”.
Its truth follows from the internal consistency of the system.
It does not require physical verification.
</p>

<p>
Formal statements are true within a defined abstract framework.
Their validity depends on logical structure,
not on observation of the physical world.
If in another mathematical structure the symbol “+” is defined
to represent subtraction instead of addition,
then within that system \(1 + 2 = 3\) is strictly false.
The truth of the statement depends entirely on the definitions adopted.
Those definitions must be precisely specified
to ensure logical consistency within that system.
</p>


<h3>Natural Sciences</h3>
<p>
Natural sciences investigate the physical world.
Their claims must be verified by observation and reproducible experiment.
A statement in natural science is accepted only if it corresponds
to measurable reality under defined conditions.
</p>

<div class="insightbox">
Formal sciences ensure logical consistency.  
Natural sciences ensure correspondence with physical reality.
</div>

</section>



<hr>

<section>

<h2>2. Physics within Natural Science</h2>

<p>
Physics is the most foundational branch of natural science.
It studies the structural components of reality:
</p>

<div class="model-box">
<ul>
<li><strong>Space</strong></li>
<li><strong>Time</strong></li>
<li><strong>Matter</strong></li>
<li><strong>Energy</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Chemistry studies interactions of matter.
Biology studies organized systems of matter.
Astronomy studies large-scale structures in space.
All depend upon physical laws.
</p>

<p>
Physics attempts to describe the most general relations
that all physical systems must obey.
</p>

</section>

<hr>

<section>

<h2>3. Physics as a Quantitative Discipline</h2>

<p>
Physics does not merely describe events.
It assigns measurable quantities to them.
</p>

<p>
A physical event is described by identifying
the quantities involved
and the relations between them.
Length, mass, time, velocity, force, temperature —
these are not words,
they are measurable properties.
</p>

<p>
To measure is to compare a physical property
with a chosen standard.
The result is expressed as:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
Quantity = Numerical Value × Unit
</p>

<p>
Without measurement, description remains qualitative.
With measurement, description becomes quantitative.
</p>

<p>
Physics advances by converting observable events
into mathematical relations between measurable quantities.
</p>

<div class="insightbox">
In physics, an event becomes scientifically meaningful
only when it is expressed in measurable terms.
</div>

</section>

<hr>

<section>

<h2>4. Change and Invariance</h2>

<p>
The physical world is a world of change.
Objects move.
Temperatures vary.
Systems evolve.
</p>

<p>
Physics studies change,
but it does so in a structured way.
It asks:
</p>

<ul>
<li>What changes?</li>
<li>How does it change?</li>
<li>What causes the change?</li>
<li>What remains unchanged during the process?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Cause and effect relations allow us
to relate one measurable change to another.
When such relations are quantified,
we gain predictive control over the system.
</p>

<p>
At the same time,
physics identifies invariants —
quantities that remain constant despite change.
</p>

<p>
Conservation of energy,
conservation of momentum,
and other invariance principles
provide structural stability to our description of nature.
</p>

<div class="insightbox">
Understanding a system means identifying
both its changes and its invariants.
</div>

</section>

<hr>

<section>

<h2>5. Reproducibility</h2>

<p>
In formal sciences,
definitions must be precise
to avoid contradiction.
</p>

<p>
Natural sciences require a similar discipline —
but applied to physical setups.
</p>

<p>
An experiment must be conducted
under clearly defined conditions.
Measurements must be repeatable.
Definitions of quantities must be unambiguous.
</p>

<p>
If an experiment cannot be reproduced
under the same defined conditions,
its result cannot become scientific knowledge.
</p>

<p>
Reproducibility is the bridge
between individual observation
and shared scientific truth.
</p>

<div class="insightbox">
Just as logical consistency validates formal systems,
reproducibility validates natural science.
</div>

</section>
<section>

<h2>5. What Makes Both “Science”?</h2>

<p>
Formal sciences demand logical consistency.
Every definition must be precise.
Every deduction must follow valid rules.
If a contradiction appears,
the system collapses.
</p>

<p>
Natural sciences demand reproducibility.
Every experimental setup must be clearly defined.
Every quantity must be measurable.
Every result must be repeatable under the same conditions.
If results cannot be reproduced,
the claim collapses.
</p>

<p>
In both cases,
the requirement is the same in spirit:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Clear definitions</li>
<li>Well-defined structure</li>
<li>No ambiguity</li>
<li>No hidden assumptions</li>
</ul>

<p>
In formal sciences,
this discipline ensures internal logical consistency.
</p>

<p>
In natural sciences,
this discipline ensures correspondence with physical reality.
</p>

<div class="insightbox">
Logical consistency in formal systems  
and reproducibility in physical systems  
are parallel requirements.  
This shared structural discipline is what allows both
to be called “science.”
