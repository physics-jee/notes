<h1>Physical Laws and Theories</h1>
<p class="subtitle">
Understanding how physics is structurally organized.
</p>

<section>

<h2>1. What is a Physical Law?</h2>

<p>
A physical law is a concise mathematical relation between measurable quantities. It summarizes a consistent and reproducible pattern observed in nature.
</p>

<div class="model-box">
<ul>
<li>Newton’s Second Law: \( F = ma \)</li>
<li>Hooke’s Law: \( F = -kx \) (within elastic limit)</li>
<li>Boyle’s Law: \( PV = \text{constant} \)</li>
<li>Coulomb’s Law: \( F \propto \frac{1}{r^2} \)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
A law does not explain why a phenomenon occurs. It states how measurable quantities are related under defined conditions. Its validity always depends on its domain of applicability.
</p>

<div class="insightbox">
A law summarizes an experimentally observed regularity in mathematical form.
</div>

</section>

<section>

<h2>2. What is a Scientific Theory?</h2>

<p>
A scientific theory is a coherent framework that organizes multiple laws under a common set of assumptions and fundamental principles.
</p>

<p>
A theory explains laws by identifying deeper structural relations.
</p>

<div class="model-box">
<ul>
<li><strong>Kinetic Theory</strong> explains gas laws using molecular motion.</li>
<li><strong>Classical Mechanics</strong> organizes laws of motion under Newton’s postulates.</li>
<li><strong>Electrodynamics</strong> unifies electric and magnetic laws.</li>
<li><strong>Quantum Theory</strong> organizes atomic-scale phenomena.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="insightbox">
A theory is not a stronger law. It is an explanatory structure that connects and derives laws. But its domain is larger than the domain of a law. It explains multiple laws of that domain.
</div>

</section>

<hr>

<section>

<h2>3. Sub-Branches of Physics</h2>

<p>
Physics is organized into sub-branches based on the theoretical frameworks used.
</p>

<div class="model-box">
<ul>
<li><strong>Mechanics</strong> — motion and forces</li>
<li><strong>Thermodynamics</strong> — heat and energy transformations</li>
<li><strong>Waves and Acoustics</strong> — oscillations and wave propagation</li>
<li><strong>Electrodynamics</strong> — electric and magnetic phenomena</li>
<li><strong>Optics</strong> — behavior of light</li>
<li><strong>Modern Physics</strong> — dual nature of light, atoms, nuclei, semiconductors</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
In addition, there are foundational chapters (General Physics) common to all sub-branches:
</p>

<div class="model-box">
<ul>
<li>Physical World</li>
<li>Units and Dimensions</li>
<li>Measurement and Errors</li>
<li>Mathematical Tools</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="insightbox">
Sub-branches differ in subject matter, but they share common structural principles.
</div>

</section>

<hr>

<section>

<h2>4. Conservation Principles Across Branches</h2>

<p>
Certain principles are not confined to one branch. They apply universally across physics.
</p>

<div class="model-box">
<ul>
<li>Conservation of Energy</li>
<li>Conservation of Momentum</li>
<li>Conservation of Angular Momentum</li>
<li>Conservation of Charge</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
These conservation principles express structural invariances of nature. They allow us to analyze systems even when full dynamical details are unknown.
</p>

<p>
For example, in collision problems we may not know the exact forces during impact, yet conservation of momentum allows prediction of outcomes.
</p>

<div class="insightbox">
Conservation laws act as structural constraints that remain valid across different domains of physics.
</div>

</section>

<hr>

<section>

<h2>5. Architectural View of Physics</h2>

<p>
Physics can therefore be viewed structurally:
</p>

<div class="model-box">
<ul>
<li>Experiments reveal patterns</li>
<li>Patterns are expressed as laws</li>
<li>Laws are organized within theories</li>
<li>Theories define sub-branches</li>
<li>Conservation principles constrain all branches</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="insightbox">
Physics is not a list of formulas. It is a structured architecture of laws, theories, and universal principles.
