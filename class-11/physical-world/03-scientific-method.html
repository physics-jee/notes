<h1>Science: Method and Knowledge</h1>
<p class="subtitle">
Understanding science as both a disciplined method and an organized body of knowledge.
</p>

<section>

<h2>1. Science as Method and Knowledge</h2>

<p>
Science has two inseparable meanings.
</p>

<div class="model-box">
<ul>
<li><strong>Science as a methodology</strong> — a disciplined way of investigating the physical world.</li>
<li><strong>Science as a body of knowledge</strong> — the organized collection of facts, laws, and theories obtained through that methodology.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
The body of knowledge is valid only because it has been built using the method.
</p>

<div class="insightbox">
Science is not just what we know. It is how we know it.
</div>

</section>

<hr>

<section>

<h2>2. Reproducibility and Controlled Experiment</h2>

<p>
A scientific claim becomes reliable only if it can be independently reproduced.
</p>

<p>Reproducibility requires:</p>

<div class="model-box">
<ul>
<li>Clearly defined experimental setup</li>
<li>Controlled environmental conditions</li>
<li>Standardized measurement procedures</li>
<li>Explicitly stated assumptions</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Without control of conditions, results cannot be verified.
</p>

<div class="insightbox">
Scientific knowledge is conditional upon well-defined experimental circumstances.
</div>

</section>

<hr>

<section>

<h2>3. Scientific Laws and Their Domains</h2>

<p>
A scientific law expresses a consistent quantitative relation between measurable quantities. However, every law has a domain of validity.
</p>

<div class="model-box">
<h3>Examples of Domain Conditions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Newton’s Laws</strong> apply in inertial frames and at speeds much less than the speed of light.</li>
<li><strong>Hooke’s Law</strong> is valid only within the elastic limit of a material.</li>
<li><strong>Coulomb’s Law</strong> strictly applies to point charges or spherically symmetric charge distributions.</li>
<li><strong>Ohm’s Law</strong> holds only when temperature and physical properties of the conductor remain constant.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="insightbox">
<p>
A scientific law is something that is found to be consistent with experiment. For example, Newton’s laws were formulated to describe observed regularities in motion. Their validity rests on repeated experimental confirmation. If anyone wishes to counter a scientific law, it must be done through carefully defined experimental evidence. Therefore, scientific laws are always conditional. Their validity depends on specified assumptions and clearly defined conditions.
</p>

<p>
If someone claims that a law fails, the failure must be demonstrated under the same clearly defined conditions in which the law is stated to apply. If the conditions differ, we are no longer testing the same law, but a different regime of nature.
</p>
</div>

</section>

<hr>

<section>

<h2>4. Refinement and Extension</h2>

<p>
Scientific knowledge is not absolute. It is progressively refined. This characteristic of Scientific knowledge is exactly what makes it a very powerful method to acquire knowledge. 
</p>

<p>
For example, Classical mechanics works within a wide range of conditions but still there are some conditions in which it does not work. In those extreme conditions, we need relativity and quantum mechanics to extend its applicability.
</p>

<p>
Thus, new theories expand domains; they do not arbitrarily discard verified results. We can modify and reuse the structure. Everything that we study does not get discarded. Overall, there is a gradual steady evolution - improvement for the better. This is the principle reason of its survivability. Science is here to stay as it is changeable.
</p>

<div class="insightbox">
Science survives not because it claims certainty, but because it allows correction. Its strength lies in its ability to revise itself when confronted with new evidence.
</div>

</section>

<hr>

<section>

<h2>5. Why This Matters for Physics</h2>

<p>
Physics relies heavily on precise measurement and clearly defined conditions.
</p>

<p>Its laws are powerful because:</p>

<div class="model-box">
<ul>
<li>They are experimentally verified</li>
<li>They are mathematically expressed</li>
<li>They specify their domains of validity</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="insightbox">
The reliability of physics comes from reproducibility, precision, evolvability and clearly stated limits.
