<h1>The Physical World</h1>
<p class="subtitle">
From phenomenological appearance to structural description.
</p>

<section>

<h2>1. Shared Objective Reality</h2>

<p>
The physical world is the objective reality that exists independently of subjective (individual) imagination.
</p>

<p>
When the Sun rises, it rises for all observers at that location. When it stands overhead at noon, it is overhead for everyone there. When it sets, it sets for all. It is the same Sun for all. We share this reality. Hence, the state of Sun in the sky at a location is an objective reality, irrespective of how a person feels or thinks about it.
</p>

<p>
Even if no one believes in it, the physical world is what it is. Some of you may believe in ghosts and others may not believe. But, if the Earth stops rotating, then it will impact everyone on Earth.
</p>

<div class="insightbox">
The existence and reality of physical world does not depend on our opinions and imaginations and beliefs. 
</div>

<h2>2. Contrast with the Imaginary</h2>

<p>
Human imagination is powerful. One may daydream of winning heroic battles or of saving damsels in distress.
</p>

<p>
But these experiences do not occur in shared space and time. They leave no physical trace. They cannot be independently verified.
</p>

<p>
The physical world is shared. Imaginary worlds are private. This section explains what is the difference between something being <b>"subjective"</b> v/s <b>"objective"</b>. 
</p>

</section>

<hr>

<h2>3. Early Attempts to Describe Reality</h2>

<p>
Ancient thinkers described reality through direct sensory appearance.
</p>

<p>
The Aristotelian model proposed five elements: Earth, Water, Air, Fire, and Ether. ("Aristotle" name is  used to indicate the era of "early" and not any personal opinion about Aristotle as a person. What Aristotle assumed was assumed by most of the thinkers of that time.)
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Earth</strong> — solid, heavy, stable</li>
<li><strong>Water</strong> — fluid and flowing</li>
<li><strong>Air</strong> — invisible but present</li>
<li><strong>Fire</strong> — transformative</li>
<li><strong>Ether</strong> — substance of the heavens</li>
</ul>

<div class="insightbox">
The Aristotelian model was a behaviour-based categorization. Such an approach of classifying entities is called "phenomenological" approach — it described how nature appears to behave to us as humans, and not on what fundamentally exists.
</div>

</section>

<h2>4. Behaviour-based Categorization vs Structural Description</h2>

<p>
A phenomenological model classifies observations of behaviour. It groups things based on how they look, how they behave, or how they are experienced by humans. Such classifications are useful, but they may not reflect the deeper structure of reality. By "deeper" we mean a level of description beyond the natural capacity of unaided human senses. For example, bacteria are invisible to the naked eye. Before microscopes were invented, germ theory of diseases could not be directly observed. Instead, diseases were explained through the miasma theory. Miasma was a form of "bad air" believed to arise from rotting organic matter. It was considered as the primary cause of Cholera and Black death plague deaths. This too is not "entirely" wrong and so, if your mom tells you to keep yourself clean as a prevention against diseases, she is right. But its just that this is right at that superficial level at which we can perceive and understand things.       
</p>

<p>
So, humans need a different approach to study the physical world. An approach that will be true in a "deeper" sense even beyond the natural capacity of human senses. To understand this difference of approach, we can consider a simple example: think of a table placed in front of you.
</p>

<p>
A phenomenological description would say: the table is wooden, it is brown, it has four legs, it is rectangular, it is used for writing.
</p>

<p>
These statements describe how the object appears and how we relate to it. But none of these properties are strictly necessary. A table can be metallic. It can be round. It can have a single central support. It can be black instead of brown. It will still be a "table".
</p>

<p>
So what is the minimum requirement for a piece of furniture to be called as a table?
</p>

<p>
Structurally, a table requires:
</p>

<ul>
<li>A plane solid surface</li>
<li>Elevation relative to the ground</li>
<li>Stable under normal conditions</li>
<li>Capable of supporting load</li>
</ul>

<p>
Everything else is variation. Color, material, number of legs — these are contingent properties (contingent here means not necessary to the definition. A table could be blue or white; its color is not part of its structural definition). They do not define the "table" (or the structure of a table) even if we as humans can sense these things.
</p>

<p>
A structural description identifies the <b>minimum necessary</b> conditions without which the object would cease to be what it is. These necessary properties are called as <b>characteristics</b> of the entity as they define its character (or structure). 
</p>

<p>
This shift of approach of studying the physical world can be tracked from Aristotle to Galileo. The thinkers are named to just pin point the timeline and not as a person. Instead of grouping nature into categories like earth, water, air, and fire based on observable behavior, structural descriptions asked: what must fundamentally exist for any physical phenomenon to occur?
</p>

<p>
The answer was structural: space, time, matter, energy and the quantitative relations between them.
</p>

<div class="insightbox">
Structural description begins when we stop organizing appearances and begin identifying the structural requirements for any natural phenomena to exist at all. It basically changed the definition of a <b>"natural phenomenon"</b> itself. Previously, a "natural phenomenon" is an event that occurs in the physical world that can be <b>"sensed"</b> (observed / perceived) by a human. But, there exists so many phenomena that take place even though we cannot observe them directly. We need a different approach based on structure. Once we adopt a structural framework, we can apply logical deduction — including <b>cause and effect</b> — even when direct perception is absent. An approach that says "if there is smoke, there is fire" even if the fire is not visible directly.

<h2>5. Structural Model</h2>

<p>
The structural model of the physical world is not fixed forever. It evolves as our understanding deepens further. But any study must begin with a working framework. For our syllabus, that framework is <b>Classical Physics</b>. It forms the foundation of most high-school physics and all its assumptions remain valid within its domain.
</p>

<p>
In classical physics, reality itself (physical world) is modelled using four structural components:
</p>

<div class="model-box">

<ul>
<li><strong>Space</strong></li>
<li><strong>Time</strong></li>
<li><strong>Matter (and Fields)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Energy</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Space</h3>
<p>
The three-dimensional framework within which physical objects (and fields) exist. Space allows separation. It is space that makes it meaningful to say that two objects are "at different locations". Without space, position itself has no meaning.
</p>

<h3>Time</h3>
<p>
The parameter that orders change. Time provides sequence of occurrence. It allows us to say that one state occurs before or after the other. Without time, change itself cannot be described as all configurations would collapse into a single undifferentiated state, with no notion of "before" or "after". Same molecules of water would be ice, water and steam at the same time and no rules will exist like - you need to heat water to convert into steam to use it to drive steam engines.
</p>

<h3>Matter (and Fields)</h3>
<p>
That which carries (or provides) physical properties. Matter possesses mass and charge and occupies space. Fields assign physical quantities to every point in space. Together, matter and fields provide the <b>state</b> of the physical world. They provide the degrees of freedom that describe what exists at each location.
</p>
<p>
For example, if the water in bucket A is hotter than the water in bucket B, temperature is a property of matter. The buckets occupy different regions of space, and their thermal states may differ. Similarly, fields (such as gravitational or electric fields) assign values to each point in space. We will study these in detail in 12th.
</p>

<h3>Energy</h3>
<p>
Energy is not a substance that provides parameters (properties). Temperature is the property of matter and not of energy. Energy constrains how the physical states (like being hotter or colder) can evolve in time. Lets say you want to heat the water in bucket B so that it is as hot as the water in bucket A. Now, just by lighting a match-stick and bringing it near to bucket B to heat it, you  wont be able to heat it to that temperature. You'll need firewood that has more combustion energy. This is because, changes in state are governed by energy constraints.   
</p>

<p>
If matter and fields describe <i>what exists</i>, energy constrains <i>how it can change</i>. It limits the possible transitions between states. Because energy is conserved in isolated systems, not every imaginable change is physically allowed.
</p>

</div>

<div class="insightbox">
Space allows separation. Time allows succession. Matter and fields define physical state. Energy constrains evolution.
