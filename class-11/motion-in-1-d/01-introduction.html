    <p style="text-align:center;"><em>Why physics begins with motion.</em></p>

    <section>
        <h2>Why Do We Begin Physics with Mechanics?</h2>

        <p>
            Physics seeks to understand the natural world through observation,
            measurement, and logical laws. When we examine nature at its most
            immediate and accessible level, one phenomenon stands out as the
            most common, most directly experienced, and most universally observed:
            <strong>motion</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Motion is an inseparable part of everyday human experience. We walk,
            run, and ride bicycles. Even during rest or sleep, motion does not
            cease: air continuously moves into and out of our lungs, and blood
            flows through arteries and veins.
        </p>

        <p>
            Motion is not confined to objects we can see and touch. The Earth
            rotates about its axis and revolves around the Sun. The Sun itself
            moves through the Milky Way galaxy. At every observable scale of
            the universe, motion is present.
        </p>

        <p>
            Because motion is so fundamental and so pervasive, understanding it
            becomes the first logical step in understanding the universe itself.
            Mechanics provides the basic language and laws required to describe
            motion quantitatively.
        </p>

        <div class="insightbox">
            Physics begins with mechanics not by tradition,
            but by necessity.
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>What Is Motion?</h2>

        <p>
            Motion is defined as the phenomenon in which the position of an object
            changes with time.
        </p>

        <p>
            An object is said to be in a state of <strong>motion</strong> if it
            continuously changes its position with respect to its surroundings
            as time passes. Conversely, an object is said to be at
            <strong>rest</strong> if its position does not change with respect
            to its surroundings.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, rest and motion are not absolute concepts. They are
            <strong>relative</strong>.
        </p>

        <div class="insightbox">
            Rest and motion are properties of
            the object <em>and</em> the observer together.
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Motion as the Study of Space and Time</h2>

        <p>
            At its most fundamental level, the study of motion is the study of
            <strong>space</strong> and <strong>time</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            For anything to exist meaningfully in physics, two questions must be
            answerable:
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">
            <em>Where does it exist?</em> &nbsp;&nbsp; and &nbsp;&nbsp;
            <em>When does it exist?</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            Motion arises naturally when the position of an object in space
            changes with time. Thus, motion is not an extra feature imposed on
            nature—it is a direct consequence of describing existence using
            space and time.
        </p>

        <div class="insightbox">
            Kinematics begins by assigning positions
            as functions of time.
